# Enhanced AI Prompt Building Test Cases

## Implementation Summary

The chat orchestrator now builds enhanced system prompts with the following logic:

### 1. Normal AI Enhancement

For regular AIs, the system prompt is enhanced with description and personality:

```python
def _build_enhanced_system_prompt(base_prompt, ai_name, description, personality):
    enhanced_prompt = base_prompt
    
    if description or personality:
        enhanced_prompt += "\n\n## About You:"
        
        if description:
            enhanced_prompt += f"\nDescription: {description}"
        
        if personality:
            enhanced_prompt += f"\nPersonality: {personality}"
        
        enhanced_prompt += f"\n\nYour name is {ai_name}. Respond according to your described personality and expertise."
    
    return enhanced_prompt
```

**Example Output:**
```
You are a Python expert AI assistant.

## About You:
Description: Expert in Python programming, web frameworks, and data science
Personality: Friendly, patient, and thorough in explanations

Your name is PyMaster. Respond according to your described personality and expertise.
```

### 2. Moderator AI Enhancement

For the moderator AI (ID: `10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000007`), the prompt includes all available AIs in the room:

```python
def _build_moderator_system_prompt(base_prompt, room_id, ai_name, description, personality):
    # First enhance with moderator's own description/personality
    enhanced_prompt = _build_enhanced_system_prompt(base_prompt, ai_name, description, personality)
    
    # Then add available AIs from the room
    # Fetches from room_ai table -> gets AI details from ai table
    
    enhanced_prompt += "\n\n## Available AI Mentors in this room:"
    for ai in room_ais:
        enhanced_prompt += f"\n- Name: {ai['name']}. Description: {ai['description']}. Personality: {ai['personality']}."
    
    enhanced_prompt += "\n\nAs the moderator, you can help users choose the right AI mentor based on their needs."
```

**Example Output:**
```
You are the room moderator AI.

## About You:
Description: Room moderator that helps users find the right AI mentor
Personality: Professional, helpful, and knowledgeable about all AI mentors

Your name is Moderator. Respond according to your described personality and expertise.

## Available AI Mentors in this room:
- Name: Python Expert. Description: Specializes in Python, Django, and FastAPI. Personality: Patient and detailed.
- Name: JavaScript Guru. Description: Expert in React, Node.js, and TypeScript. Personality: Energetic and practical.
- Name: Data Scientist. Description: Machine learning and data analysis expert. Personality: Analytical and precise.

As the moderator, you can help users choose the right AI mentor based on their needs.
```

## Key Features

1. **Enhanced Context**: AIs now have clear understanding of their role through description and personality
2. **Moderator Awareness**: Moderator AI knows about all available AIs in the room
3. **Fallback Handling**: If fetching room AIs fails, moderator still gets basic enhancement
4. **Applied Everywhere**: Both `stream_response()` and `process_streaming_response()` use the enhanced prompts

## Database Fields Used

From `ai` table:
- `system_prompt`: Base system prompt
- `name`: AI name
- `description`: AI's expertise and capabilities
- `personality`: AI's personality traits

From `room_ai` table (for moderator only):
- Links to get all active AIs in a specific room

## Testing the Implementation

To test with real data:

1. **Normal AI Test**:
   - Create/update an AI with description and personality
   - Send a chat request
   - AI should respond according to its personality

2. **Moderator AI Test**:
   - Add multiple AIs to a room
   - Send a chat request to the moderator AI
   - Moderator should be able to describe available AIs

Example SQL to set up test data:
```sql
-- Update a normal AI
UPDATE ai 
SET 
  description = 'Expert Python developer specializing in FastAPI and async programming',
  personality = 'Friendly, patient, loves to explain concepts with examples'
WHERE id = 'your-ai-id';

-- Update moderator AI
UPDATE ai
SET
  description = 'Room moderator that helps coordinate between different AI mentors',
  personality = 'Professional, organized, and knowledgeable about all available experts'
WHERE id = '10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000007';
```
